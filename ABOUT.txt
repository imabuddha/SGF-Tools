The SGF.mdimporter indexes SGF game files on Mac OSX 10.6.  

This program is open source, and is hosted here: 
	http://github.com/threeve/SGF-Tools

All of the sgf properties in the "SGFimporter Prop-Attr Mapping.rtf" file have
been implemented so you can get really specific about searching (if desired).  
The following properties appear in the More Info section of the OSX file Get 
Info window: Event, Game's name (title), white & black player names & ranks, 
and the result.

The best way to force the re-indexing of the metadata is to copy the current 
version to either /Library/Spotlight or ~/Library/Spotlight, (delete the old 
version first if present), then run "mdimport -r FULL_PATH" where FULL_PATH is 
the complete path + name of the importer.  Without the full path it won't work.  

To get the custom attributes to appear in the list of other available search 
attributes you may have to do a restart.  Before the restart these attributes
are indexed & will match a general search or raw query, however that's not 
nearly as convenient. ;-)

Let us know if you encounter any problems, have questions, or would like to 
make suggestions.
