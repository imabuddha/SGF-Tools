The SGF-Tools project is a set of SGF game file utilities for Mac OSX 10.6.  

This project is open source, and is hosted here: 
	http://github.com/threeve/SGF-Tools

Binary releases & source code may be downloaded here: 
	http://github.com/threeve/SGF-Tools/downloads
	
Currently the SGF-Tools project contains a Spotlight metadata importer and a 
Quicklook preview generator for SGF files.

To install these tools run the XXXXXX.pkg OSX installer package.

The SGF.mdimporter indexes all of the sgf properties in SGF game files listed
in the file "SGFimporter Prop-Attr Mapping.rtf", allowing for very specific 
searches.  It also makes the following properties appear in the More Info 
section of the OSX file Get Info window: Event, Game's name (title), 
white & black player names & ranks, and the result.

To get the custom attributes to appear in the list of other available search 
attributes you may have to do a restart.  Before the restart these attributes
are indexed & will match a general search or raw query, however that's not 
nearly as convenient. ;-)

The SGF.qlgenerator makes it possible to see various properties without having
to open the SGF file.  (board position preview coming soon)

Let us know if you encounter any problems, have questions, or would like to 
make suggestions.
